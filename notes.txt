These files had all 0s (all wake) to begin with so I dropped them.
Removed them from the unzipped data, and dropped them in the code.


This code showed that 204015 was not in the fileids. I am removing this from the original csv.
Also showed that 200230, 202180, 202310, 203065 were not in the ids. I am removing these from the files directory.


| fileids = [filename.split('.')[0].split('-')[1] for filename in files]
| 
| df = pd.read_csv(original_csv)
| ids = [str(i) for i in df["nsrrid"].values]
| 
| # show items in ids not in files
| for i in ids:
|     if i not in fileids:
|         print(i)

# show items in files not in ids
| for i in fileids:
|     if i not in ids:
|         print("not in ids: " + i)

shhs 999999 is a test file to make sure calculations are correct.

Our timeinbed calculation is not entirely accurate, because we drop zeros from the hypnogram files.
It is a rough estimation of the start of sleep to the end of sleep.

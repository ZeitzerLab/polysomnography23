These files had all 0s (all wake) to begin with so I dropped them.

| fileids = [filename.split('.')[0].split('-')[1] for filename in files]
| 
| df = pd.read_csv(original_csv)
| ids = [str(i) for i in df["nsrrid"].values]
| 
| # show items in ids not in files
| for i in ids:
|     if i not in fileids:
|         print(i)

This code showed that 204015 was not in the fileids. I am removing this from the original csv.
